This repository is an assignment for The Odin Project, which is a free 
full stack web course. The directive was to use html and css to make a site that looks like the one 
below:

Now I didn't really have a good idea for what I should replace the template with, so I just tried to imitate the template itself. I found most of the work involved in creating this was editing the CSS (it's over twice as many lines as the HTML doc!) so changes in page content shouldn't be too hard, especially since the main divs are all separated by flexbox. There are a couple weird quirks though, such as how making the browser more narrow makes it look much worse and less centered. But overall this is very close to the original, and taught me a lot about how I would do something like this in the future.
